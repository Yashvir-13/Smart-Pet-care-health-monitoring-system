      `Based on ${currentPet?.name}'s recent activity levels and vital signs, we recommend a diet rich in lean proteins and moderate carbohydrates. Include 2 cups of high-quality dry food divided into two meals per day, supplemented with a tablespoon of fish oil for coat health. Ensure fresh water is always available and limit treats to 10% of daily caloric intake.`,
      
      `${currentPet?.name}'s recent health data suggests a need for increased hydration. Consider switching to a wet food diet or adding water to dry kibble. We recommend 1.5 cups of premium wet food per day, divided into three meals. Add a daily probiotic supplement to support digestive health, and ensure exercise after meals to aid digestion.`,
      
      `For optimal weight management, ${currentPet?.name} should be on a portion-controlled diet with measured meals. Provide 1.75 cups of weight management formula dry food daily, split between morning and evening feedings. Include low-calorie vegetables like carrots or green beans as healthy treats, and ensure at least 30 minutes of active play daily.`,
      
      `${currentPet?.name}'s vital signs indicate potential food sensitivities. Consider a limited ingredient diet focusing on novel proteins like duck or venison. Start with 2 cups daily divided into two meals, and monitor for improvements in digestion and energy levels. Avoid common allergens like chicken, beef, and grains until sensitivities are better understood.`,
      
      `To support ${currentPet?.name}'s joint health, we recommend a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and glucosamine. Feed 2 cups of senior-formula dry food daily, supplemented with a teaspoon of fish oil and a joint health supplement. Keep meals consistent in timing and quantity, and provide gentle, regular exercise to maintain mobility.`,
      `To boost ${currentPet?.name}'s immune system, introduce antioxidant-rich foods such as blueberries and spinach mixed with regular meals. Add a multivitamin supplement approved by your vet, and maintain consistent meal times to support metabolic health.`,

    `If ${currentPet?.name} is experiencing digestive issues, opt for a bland diet for a few days. Boiled chicken and rice in equal parts can help stabilize digestion. Slowly reintroduce regular food once symptoms improve.`,

    `${currentPet?.name} could benefit from a high-fiber diet to support gut health. Include pumpkin puree or psyllium husk mixed into meals. Feed 2 cups per day, and monitor stool quality for any changes.`,

    `For a shiny coat and healthy skin, enrich ${currentPet?.name}'s diet with omega-3 supplements and natural fats. Salmon-based dry food or cooked egg yolks in moderation are great additions.`,

    `${currentPet?.name} requires a high-energy diet due to elevated activity levels. Offer energy-dense foods like performance-formula kibble and snacks containing sweet potato and peanut butter.`,

    `If ${currentPet?.name} is recovering from surgery or illness, a protein- and calorie-dense diet is essential. Add cottage cheese, scrambled eggs, or vet-approved recovery formula to meals.`,

    `${currentPet?.name} shows signs of anxiety. Consider diets with added L-theanine, chamomile, or calming ingredients. Feed smaller, more frequent meals to maintain steady energy levels.`,

    `Due to seasonal changes, ${currentPet?.name} may need additional hydration. Add broth to dry food or switch to a mix of wet and dry food. Avoid high-sodium broths.`,

    `To reduce tartar buildup, give ${currentPet?.name} dental chews and crunchy dry food that support oral health. Avoid sugary treats and table scraps.`,

    `For an underweight ${currentPet?.name}, increase caloric intake gradually using nutrient-dense kibble and calorie supplements. Monitor weight weekly and consult a vet for progress tracking.`,

    `${currentPet?.name}'s energy levels suggest a need for slow-burning carbs. Include brown rice, oats, or sweet potatoes in meals. Avoid corn and wheat-based fillers.`,

    `If ${currentPet?.name} is a senior, focus on joint health and kidney support. Use senior-specific dry food with lower phosphorus levels and added glucosamine.`,

    `To support urinary tract health, ensure ${currentPet?.name} consumes a moisture-rich diet with cranberry supplements or urinary care formulas. Encourage water intake throughout the day.`,

    `If ${currentPet?.name} has food allergies, transition to a hydrolyzed protein diet under vet supervision. Eliminate common allergens and introduce foods one at a time over several weeks.`,

    `${currentPet?.name} can benefit from rotational feeding. Alternate protein sources (like turkey, fish, and lamb) every few weeks to provide dietary variety and reduce intolerance risk.`,

    `Due to frequent travel or changes in routine, ${currentPet?.name} may benefit from a portable dry food diet that maintains gastrointestinal stability and is easy to pack.`,

    `For large breed dogs like ${currentPet?.name}, use food designed to prevent rapid growth. Controlled calcium and phosphorus levels help avoid joint issues later in life.`,

    `As a highly active breed, ${currentPet?.name} needs a performance diet with 30%+ protein and 20%+ fat content. Supplement with high-protein snacks post-exercise.`,

    `${currentPet?.name} may be more susceptible to diabetes. Opt for low-glycemic, high-fiber food options and maintain a strict feeding schedule with no table food.`,

    `If ${currentPet?.name} struggles with hairballs, especially cats, use a formula rich in fiber to aid digestion and help pass hair naturally. Brush frequently to reduce shedding.`,

    `For weight loss, switch ${currentPet?.name} to a low-fat, high-protein food and increase activity levels. Feed smaller portions 3â€“4 times a day and avoid all processed treats.`,
